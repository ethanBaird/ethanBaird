### Hello! I'm Ethan (he/him) 👋


🤓  I’m a CodeClan graduate looking for my first position as a software developer!

🎭  I have a background in the performing arts, optical retail and customer service.
 
🧑‍🏫  Why change career? Well, I love to learn! And in tech every day really is a school day. 

🧩  Writing code is as challenging as it is rewarding, which for me is the perfect combination. 

🎧  I'm an avid music fan and gig goer, lover of movies and musicals and quickly developing an unhealthy obsession with Formula 1 (thanks Drive To Survive...)
